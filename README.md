# COS316, Assignment 1: Socket Programming

## Socket Programming

Socket programming is the standard way to write programs
that communicate over a network. While originally developed for Unix computers
programmed in C, the socket abstraction is general and not tied to any specific
operating system or programming language. This allows programmers to use the socket
mental model to write correct network programs in many contexts.

This part of the assignment will give you experience with basic socket
programming. You will write two programs for transmitting bytes over the
Internet: 1) a client for sending, and 2) a server for receiving. Both the
client and server must be written in Go. See more about their specifications in their respective sections.

### Getting started

If you haven't already, please refer to the `setup_directions.md` setup document
to install all the necessary tools needed for your local environment.

After doing so, you can work on this assignment directly on your physical machine and use any editor 
you have installed. 

Many modern editors (Emacs, Atom, VS Code, Sublime, ...) provide convenient extensions
specifically designed for working with Golang. These extensions provide many
useful features, including:
* Automatically adding required import statements
* Automatically vetting your code for compilation errors
* Automatically formatting your code in idiomatic Go style
* Automatically running any unit tests you've written

It is strongly recommended that you install an extension appropriate for your
editor of choice to streamline your Go programming experience.

Before jumping into writing code, please also review the 'General Programming Assignment Instructions' 
section on the assignments tab of our website. 

You will need to clone your code repository from GitHub to your local machine.
The basic form of the command to do this is `git clone https://github.com/cos316-f24/<assignment#>-<unique-name>`.
You may also clone your repository using the [GitHub Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) 
(highly recommended since using its provided UI can make your workflow extremely streamlined!).


### Server specification
* The server program should listen on a socket, wait for a client to connect,
  receive input from the client, print the input to standard out, and then wait
  for the next client indefinitely.
* The server should take one command-line argument: the port number to listen on
  for client connections.
* The server should accept and process client communications indefinitely,
  allowing multiple clients to send input to the same server, one after the
  other. The server should only exit in response to an external signal (e.g.
  SIGINT from typing `ctrl-c`).
* The server should gracefully handle error values returned by socket
  programming library functions (see specifics below). Errors related to
  handling client connections should not cause the server to exit after handling
  the error; all others should.
* The server should maintain a client queue and handle multiple client
  connection attempts sequentially. The good news is, this is the default
  behavior if you are using `net.Listen()`. **You do not need to do anything
  extra to satisfy this requirement.** In real applications, a TCP server would
  likely handle each client connection concurrently with others, but that is
  **not necessary** for this assignment.

### Client specification

* The client program should contact a server, read all available bytes from
  standard in, send those bytes to the server, and exit.
* The client should read and send the bytes *exactly* as they appear in stdin
  until reaching an EOF (end-of-file).
* The client should take two command-line arguments: the IP address of the server
  and the port number of the server.
* The client must be able to handle arbitrarily large input by reading and
  sending chunks of the input, rather than reading the whole input into memory
  first.
* The client should handle partial sends (when a socket only transmits part of
  the data given in the last send operation) by attempting to re-send the rest of
  the data until it has all been sent.
* The client should gracefully handle error values potentially returned by socket
  programming library functions.

### Error Handling

Generally speaking, there are several reasonable actions that a program might take
upon realizing that it has encountered an error; which of the following actions 
you take will depend on where you encounter the error:

* **Attempt to recover:**
  Some errors may arise due to chance events like a busy or noisy network, and in these
  cases it is possible (and desirable) to try to recover gracefully, perhaps by trying
  the exact same operation again, or by tweaking some values first and then retrying.
  In this case we attempt to continue the program's execution instead of panicing/crashing.
* **Crash:**
  Terminate the program. Some errors cannot be recovered from at runtime. If the user
  requests access to some resource that is already being used by another process,
  there is no straightforward way to recover, and crashing (with an informative
  message) would be an acceptable response.
* **Print error message:**
  Especially for fatal errors that cause your program to crash, it is good style
  to print out a message indicating what has gone wrong. For non-fatal errors, you
  may find it useful to print messages for debugging purposes. For your final
  submit, you should make an effort to minimize output by commenting out any
  debugging statements.
* **Do nothing:**
  It is generally poor style to leave potential errors unhandled, as your program
  might continue executing, believing everything to be OK, only to crash later on
  in a way that will be much harder to debug. Your program should make an effort
  to handle all reasonable errors that may arise.

#### Error Handling in Go

Go has several error handling functions that may be of use to you:

* `log.Fatal(message string)`<sup>[(docs)](http://golang.org/pkg/log/#Fatal)</sup>:
  Print message to `os.Stderr` and terminate the program with a return code of 1.

* `log.Print(message string)`<sup>[(docs)](https://golang.org/pkg/log/#Print)</sup>:
  Prints message to stderr. Does not terminate the program.

* `log.Panic(message string)`<sup>[(docs)](https://golang.org/pkg/log/#Panic)</sup> 
(May not be necessary for this assignment, but good to know for later):
  Prints the error message, and then calls `panic()`, which propagates the error, and
  prints a stack trace if unhandled. `panic()` is similar to Java's `throw`.
  It differs from `log.Fatal()` in that deferred functions are executed before the
  program exits (perhaps freeing resources or flushing buffers).
  An interesting note is that callers can recover from a panic using `recover()`
  (analagous to `catch` in Java), but you also will *not* need to make use of the `recover()`
  functionality for this assignment.
  See [this blog post](https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover)
  to learn more about `defer()`, `panic()`, and `recover()`.
  

### Go & Implementation Details

The documentation for Go socket programming is located [here](https://golang.org/pkg/net/).  

The overview at the top and the section on the [Conn type](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn) will be most relevant.
You may also find the buffered [Reader](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Reader)
and [Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Writer) types to be useful, but you
aren't required to use them, and you can construct a working solution without them.

The Go language (Golang) documentation can be cryptic, so be sure to familiarize
yourself with the language a bit first, especially if you are new to Go. You may
find the [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/list) documentation useful if you
have never used Go before.

The files `client.go` and `server.go` contain the scaffolding code. You will need
to add socket programming code in the locations marked `TODO`. The reference
solutions have roughly 40  (well commented and spaced) lines of code in the
`TODO` sections of each file. Your implementations may be shorter or longer. 
You can add functions if you wish, but do not change file names, as they will be
used for automated testing.

You should build your solution by running `make` in the `assignment1` directory.
Your code *must* build using the provided Makefile.

The server should be run as `./server [port] > [output file]`.

The client can be run in two ways:
Firstly, with `./client [server IP] [server port]`, your client should wait for
input. You can then type lines of input text into the command line. `ctrl-c`
should exit the client. Alternatively, with
`./client [server IP] [server port] < [input file]`, the client receives input
text from the `[input file]`. See "Testing" for more details.

### Testing

You should test your implementation by attempting to send data from your client
to your server. You can run your server and client instances in separate terminal sessions, 
or you can run the server in the background by appending a `&` to its
command. You should use `127.0.0.1` (i.e. the
"localhost", or "loopback", address) as the server IP and a high server port
number between 10000 and 60000.

You can kill a background process with two successive commands: `fg` to bring it
to the foreground, and then `ctrl-c` to kill it. Conversely, you can send a
foreground process to the background by hitting `ctrl-z` to suspend the process,
and then typing the command `bg` to resume the process in the background.

You should test your implementation by attempting to send several different
kinds of data between your client and server. For example:

0.  Short input, e.g. "Go Tigers!\n"
0.  **Very** long, randomly generated alphanumeric data
0.  A long, randomly generated non-alphanumeric message
0.  Several short messages sent sequentially from separate clients to one server
0.  Several long, random alphaumeric messages sent concurrently from separate
    clients to one server
0.  Etc

### Debugging hints

Here are some debugging tips. If you are still having trouble, ask a question on
Ed or see an instructor during office hours.

* There are defined buffer size constants in the scaffolding code. Use them; they shouldn't need to be modified.
  If you are not using one of them, either you have hard-coded a value, which is
  bad style, or you are very likely doing something wrong.
* There are multiple ways to read and write from stdin/stdout in Go. Any method
  is acceptable as long as it does not read an unbounded amount into memory at
  once and does not modify the data.
* If you are using buffered I/O to write to stdout or a TCP connection, make
  sure to call `flush` or some of the data may not actually be written.
* Remember to close the socket at the end of the client program.
* When testing, make sure you are using `127.0.0.1` as the server IP argument to
  the client and the same server port for both client and server programs.
* If you get "address already in use" errors, make sure you don't already have a
  another instance running or a different program already listening on the same
  port (you can always use a different port number).

### Q&A

* **Do I need to handle signals such as SIGINT to clean up the server process when
  the user presses `ctrl-c`?**

  No, it is not necessary in this assignment. The default response to signals is good enough.

* **Should I use stream (TCP) or datagram (UDP) sockets?**

  Please use stream (TCP) socket. Streams ensure reliable, in-order packet
  transmission, whereas datagram packets are not guaranteed to be delivered.

* **Should I support IPv6?**

  IPv6 support is not necessary. Your code will be tested using IPv4 only,
  though if you use the Go standard library to establish TCP connections, IPv6
  will likely work as well.

* **Should the client wait to receive a reply from the server?**

  No, in this assignment it should exit immediately after sending all of the data.

* **Should the server handle client connections concurrently (in separate processes)?**

  No, as stated in the client specification, you should _not_ accept multiple
  clients concurrently. The grading tests assume and rely on you only accepting
  connections one-at-a-time.

### Submission and grading

To submit your client and server, `git commit` the changes to your code and
`git push` them to your GitHub classroom repository.

We will grade your submissions by compiling your client and server, and then
sending messages back and forth between each of your submitted programs and a
reference server or client, as appropriate. Your code will be scored based on
how many different kinds of messages are transmitted correctly, and how well
your implementation adheres to other aspects of the specification. Within a
couple minutes of submitting your assignment, the GitHub autograder will add a
comment to your most recent commit on GitHub, indicating your test results.

You may submit in this way and receive feedback as many times as you like,
whenever you like, but a lateness penalty will be applied to submissions
received after the deadline.

Code that does not compile will receive no points!
